<h3>The Best Is Yet to Come</h3>

<p>Privacy Browser is still in its infancy.  Most of the best features are yet to be implemented.  They include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SSL certificate controls</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine grained controls for cookies and DOM storage</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatically loading of privacy settings by URL</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Encrypted sync between devices</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Tabbed browsing</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated ad blocker</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A full list of planned features and bug reports is available at <a href="https://redmine.stoutner.com/projects/privacy-browser/issues">redmine.stoutner.com</a>.</p>
