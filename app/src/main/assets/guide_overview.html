<h3>True Privacy</h3>

<p>Privacy Browser is designed to let you take as much control of your privacy as possible while still browsing the internet.
    When you connect to a website, certain pieces of information which are necessary to facilitate the connection are transferred to the server.
    For example, the server will receive your IP address and a port number, which are necessary so it knows where to send the response.
    This information is often logged by the server, allowing the website developer to produce reports showing how often a webpage was loaded
    and how many different IP addresses accessed it.</p>

<p>However, most website operators want to track your web browsing across multiple websites, not just on a single server.  There are many techniques they use to do so.
    Some of them involve requesting or placing extra information on your device that facilitates this tracking.  Almost all browsers will voluntarily participate in this tracking
    without informing the user they are doing so.  Privacy Browser is designed to grant the user as much information and control over these tracking techniques as possible.</p>


<h3>WebView Limitations</h3>

<p>Privacy Browser uses Android's built-in WebView to render websites.  There are some limitations in the controls WebView exposes for managing privacy settings.  For example,
    it isn't possible to enable some JavaScript commands while disabling others.  It also isn't possible to control the
    <a href="https://blog.fastmail.com/2016/06/20/everything-you-could-ever-want-to-know-and-more-about-controlling-the-referer-header/">referer header</a>.
    Once Privacy Browser has matured to take full advantage of all the privacy options WebView does offer, some consideration might be made to imbedding a customized WebView
    or using a different rendering engine.</p>
